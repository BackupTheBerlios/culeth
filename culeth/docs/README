Rationale
=========

CULeth is intended to make CUL an ethernet hub. CUL is to pass ethernet II
frames between a PC and CC11xx transceiver based devices such as Betty with Boop
firmware (see http://www.bettyhacks.com).

On USB, CUL appears on the host as an ethernet adapter with a proper IP address.
The IP address is 10.0.0.xxx. This is the host's IP address.

Packages from the host with a destination in the subnet 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 pass
through that interface and are transmitted to air. Packages from the air are
send via the CUL interface to the host. CUL is completely agnostic of the higher
level protocols used in the ethernet frames it passes from Betty to host hither
and yon.

As a gimmick, CULeth simulates a simple host with the following features:
- answer ARP requests
- support ICMP ping echos

CULeth is a derivative of the RNDISEthernet demo from LUFA (see
http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php).


Install / Flash the firmware
============================

1. Change into the source directory
2. Insert the USB-Stick while pressing the micro-switch.

   A USB device "03eb:2ffa Atmel Corp." should appear.

    dfu-programmer at90usb162 erase
    dfu-programmer at90usb162 flash CULeth.hex
    Validating...
    6312 bytes used (51.37%)
    dfu-programmer at90usb162 start

  The last command will reset the device, a new USB device should appear:
  "03eb:204c Atmel Corp."


For convenience, the above command sequence is scripted in the executable
tools/flash.

If all is fine, the logs will show a new usb device (use dmesg):

usb 1-9: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 98
usb 1-9: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
rndis_host 1-9:1.0: dev can't take 144 byte packets (max 144), adjusting MTU to 86
rndis_host 1-9:1.0: RNDIS_MSG_QUERY(0x00010202) failed, -47
usb0: register 'rndis_host' at usb-0000:00:0b.0-9, RNDIS device, 02:00:02:00:02:00
usb 1-9: New USB device found, idVendor=03eb, idProduct=204c
usb 1-9: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
usb 1-9: Product: CULeth RNDIS CDC
usb 1-9: Manufacturer: busware.de



Usage of CULeth
===============

ifconfig usb0 10.0.0.1 up
ping -s 20 10.0.0.2		# small icmp packets due to small mtu

Tips & Tricks
=============
openSuSE 11.x:

If you want to program CUL without the need to become root, add new file

69-cul.rules

in the directory /etc/udev/rules.d/ with the following contents:

SYSFS{idVendor}=="03eb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="2ffa", BUS=="usb", MODE="0666"
