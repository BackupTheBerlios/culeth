Rationale
=========

CULeth is intended to make CUL an ethernet hub. CUL is to pass ethernet II
frames between a PC and CC11xx transceiver based devices such as Betty with Boop
firmware (see http://www.bettyhacks.com).

On USB, CUL appears on the host as an ethernet adapter with a proper IP address.
In standard configuration, the IP address is 192.168.108.1. This is the host's
IP address.

Packages from the host with a destination in the subnet 192.168.108.0/255.0.0.0
pass through that interface and are transmitted to air. Packages from air are
sent via the CUL interface to the host. CUL is completely agnostic of the higher
level protocols used in the ethernet frames it passes from Betty to host hither
and yon.

CULeth simulates a simple host (CULServer) with the following features:
- answer ARP requests
- support ICMP ping echos
- reply to UDP requests on port 7073 for testing, monitoring, configuring CUL

***** IMPORTANT NOTICE: the current version of CULeth wraps packages received
on air into UDP packets and sends them to port 2211 on host 192.168.108.1. They
packets can be monitored by means of the tools/target.pl (see below).


CULeth is a derivative of the RNDISEthernet demo from LUFA (see
http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php).


Install / Flash the firmware
============================

1. Change into the source directory
2. Insert the USB stick while pressing the micro-switch. Release the micro-switch
   one or two seconds after having inserted the USB stick.

   A USB device "03eb:2ffa Atmel Corp." should appear.

    dfu-programmer at90usb162 erase
    dfu-programmer at90usb162 flash CULeth.hex
    Validating...
    6312 bytes used (51.37%)
    dfu-programmer at90usb162 start

  The last command will reset the device, a new USB device should appear:
  "03eb:204c Atmel Corp."


For convenience, the above command sequence is scripted in the executable
tools/flash.

If all is fine, the logs will show a new usb device (use dmesg):

usb 1-9: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 98
usb 1-9: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
rndis_host 1-9:1.0: dev can't take 144 byte packets (max 144), adjusting MTU to 86
rndis_host 1-9:1.0: RNDIS_MSG_QUERY(0x00010202) failed, -47
usb0: register 'rndis_host' at usb-0000:00:0b.0-9, RNDIS device, 02:00:02:00:02:01
usb 1-9: New USB device found, idVendor=03eb, idProduct=204c
usb 1-9: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
usb 1-9: Product: CULeth RNDIS CDC
usb 1-9: Manufacturer: busware.de



Interface setup
===============

ifconfig usb0 192.168.108.1 up
ping 192.168.108.101

This configures CUL as a host interface with IP address 192.168.108.1 and sets
a default route to 192.168.108.0/24 via usb0. The ping command pings the
CULServer built into CULeth.

Packet sniffing:
tcpdump -e -i usb0 -n -U -v -s 200 -X


CULServer communication
=======================

CULServer configuration tool cstool
-----------------------------------

Use tools/cstool.pl to talk to the CULServer. The user interface is
self-explanatory. The command ? will give you the following menu:

CUL functions:
  B - start bootloader
  r - reboot
RNDIS functions:
  A - set adapter MAC address
CULServer functions:
  M - set CULServer MAC address
  S - set CULServer IP address and port
  T - set target IP address and port
  e - get EEPROM data
 E1 - EEPROM factory reset (config #1)
 E2 - EEPROM factory reset (config #2)
  b - blink
 pa - send test packet on air
 pt - send test packet to target
CC1101 functions:
  s - get CC1101 status
  c - get CC1101 configuration
Miscellaneous functions:
  t - get CULServer time
  x - exit

cstool connects to a CULServer on port 49152 at IP address 192.168.108.101.
If your CULServer is on another IP address or port, start cstool with

cstool [remotehost[:remoteport]]

Examples: 	cstool 192.168.109.127
		cstool 192.168.111.111:1111

The default configurations, which can be set by E1 or E2, are as follows:

config #1:
Adapter MAC     = 02:00:02:00:02:01
Server MAC      = 02:50:8b:00:00:01
Server IP:port  = 192.168.108.101:49152
Target IP:port  = 192.168.108.1:2211

config #2:
Adapter MAC     = 02:00:02:00:02:02
Server MAC      = 02:50:8b:00:00:02
Server IP:port  = 192.168.108.102:49152
Target IP:port  = 192.168.108.1:2212

After having started the bootloader with B or after a version change in the
configuration, config #1 is active.

Target
------

CULeth sends packets from air to a configurable target. In the default
configuration this is port 2211 on IP address 192.168.108.1, i.e. the host.

Use tools/target.pl to listen to incoming requests from the CULServer on the
host.

If port 2211 is busy you can configure CULServer to forward UDP packets to
another port on the target. In this case start target with

target [port]

Examples:	target 4711
		target 10000


The pt test feature of CULServer sends a test message to the host (4 bytes time
stamp first). Every packet that runs through the hub sends a notice to the host
(4 bytes time stamp followed by the number of the source and destination
interfaces, see Interfaces.h).


Sniffing CULeth communication
=============================

See http://developer.berlios.de/projects/culfw/ for details on culfw!

Use a second CUL and put culfw on it. Plug it into the USB port. A device

	/dev/ttyACM0

should appear. Type

	screen /dev/ttyACM0

to communicate with culfw. Try the following commands:

(1) tune CUL to 433.249 MHz:
W0F10
W10A9
W11D6

Fcarrier= Value * 26MHz/65536 => 433.249 MHz corresponds to 10A9D6

IMPORTANT: unplug/plug CUL to activate the setting!

(2) listen
X09

The pa test feature of CULServer sends a test message on air. The test message
can be seen by culfw.


Two-way communication
=====================

You need two CUL. Flash culeth on the two of them, in the following called
CUL-A and CUL-B. CUL-A is left a its default configuration. CUL-B is
configured to use an alternate subnet.

Configuring CUL-A and CUL-B
---------------------------

Unplug both.

CUL-A is left in its default configuration:
- Adapter MAC     = 02:00:02:00:02:01
- Server MAC      = 02:50:8b:00:00:01
- Server IP:port  = 192.168.108.101:49152
- Target IP:port  = 192.168.108.1:2211

There is nothing to do with CUL-A.

CUL-B needs to be tweaked to use the following configuration:
- Adapter MAC     = 02:00:02:00:02:02
- Server MAC      = 02:50:8b:00:00:02
- Server IP:port  = 192.168.108.102:49152
- Target IP:port  = 192.168.108.1:2212

Plug CUL-B. A device usb0 should appear on the host. Configure it with

ifconfig usb0 192.168.108.1 up

Run cstool to set config #2 with E2. Unplug CUL-B. CUL-B is now configured.

Plug CUL-A. Configure it with

ifconfig usb0 192.168.108.1 up

Plug CUL-B. Configure it with

ifconfig usb1 192.168.108.2 up

You can now talk to CUL-A with cstool and to CUL-B with cstool 192.168.108.2


Test setup
----------

Open 4 terminals.

Plug CUL-A. ifconfig usb0 192.168.108.1 up. Run cstool in terminal 1. Run
target 2211 in terminal 2. Check wether you can send test packets to the target in
terminal 2 by means of the CULServer command pt.

Plug CUL-B. ifconfig usb1 192.168.109.1 up. Run cstool 192.168.109.127 in
terminal 3. Run target 2212 in terminal 4. Check wether you can send test packets
to the target in terminal 4 by means of the CULServer command pt.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: as reception is not yet functional, the following does not work:

You should now be able to send packets on air from CUL-A to CUL-B and vice versa.
Use the CULServer command pa. A packet transmitted from CUL-A is received by
CUL-B, wrapped into an UDP packet and forwarded to port 2212. A packet transmitted
from CUL-B is received by CUL-A, wrapped into an UDP packet and forwarded to port
2211.


CULeth internals
================

The main function is in CULeth.c. The hub function is Ethernet_Task. It receives
a packet from an interface and forwards it on air, to the CULServer or both
(broadcasts).

Due to the small memory (512 bytes of RAM), the packet length (MTU) is quite
limited. Packets cannot be stored. Only one packet at a time, either incoming or
outgoing, can be handled.

If a message passing through the hub triggers an extra packet to be sent out,
then this is done in extras.c.


Tips & Tricks
=============
openSuSE 11.x:

If you want to program CUL without the need to become root, add new file

69-cul.rules

in the directory /etc/udev/rules.d/ with the following contents:

SYSFS{idVendor}=="03eb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="2ffa", BUS=="usb", MODE="0666"
